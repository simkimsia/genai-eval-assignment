  "code_explanation_clarity": {
    "score": 4,
    "justification": "The code includes clear comments explaining the purpose of each modification. The changes are logically structured with inline explanations about JSON parsing, validation checks, and error scenarios. The code demonstrates intent through descriptive variable names and explicit error handling paths."
  },
  "implementation_approach": {
    "score": 5,
    "justification": "The implementation shows a thoughtful, comprehensive approach to solving the client creation workflow. It introduces robust validation, prevents duplicate client creation, handles JSON parsing safely, and provides flexible error responses. The approach considers multiple scenarios like missing fields, existing references, and potential input errors."
  },
  "error_handling_quality": {
    "score": 5,
    "justification": "Exceptional error handling is demonstrated through multiple layers of validation. The code checks for JSON decoding errors, validates required fields, prevents duplicate reference numbers, handles specific exceptions like ValidationError and KeyError, and provides meaningful HTTP status codes. The commented logging suggestion also indicates consideration for debugging and production monitoring."
